### About
This is a place for me to learn Python and Django. It's a slightly contrived app aiming to help users decide which of their preferred sports they should be doing on any particular date, and to send notifications when conditions are good for a particular sport.

### Gotchas
- C++ compiler needed to install mysqlclient in python
- gettext library needed by django to generate translation files, on windows this needs to be downloaded from a third party repo: http://mlocati.github.io/articles/gettext-iconv-windows.html
